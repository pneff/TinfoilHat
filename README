TinfoilHat
==========

TinfoilHat is a httplib2_ extension that is more paranoid about input. It won't
allow downloading data from private IP ranges.

This library was inspired by, but is not yet as paranoid as, Perl's `LWPx::ParanoidAgent`_.

Example usage
-------------

TinfoilHat is a drop-in replacement for httplib2:

>>> import tinfoilhat
>>> client = tinfoilhat.Http()
>>> client.request('http://0.1.2.3/')
...
tinfoilhat.BlockedError: Host name 0.1.2.3 is blocked


You can also specify an additional blacklist as a list of regular expressions:

>>> import tinfoilhat
>>> client = tinfoilhat.Http(blacklist=['83\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+'])
>>> client.request('http://83.5.6.7')
...
tinfoilhat.BlockedError: Host name 83.5.6.7 is blocked
